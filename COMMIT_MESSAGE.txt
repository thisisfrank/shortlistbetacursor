Fix: Prevent auth from consuming password reset tokens

PROBLEM:
Password reset tokens were being consumed by normal auth initialization
before the ResetPasswordPage component could use them, causing "No 
recovery tokens found" error.

SOLUTION:
Skip normal auth initialization when on /reset-password page with
recovery tokens present in URL. This preserves the tokens so
ResetPasswordPage can manually handle the session setup.

CHANGES:
- src/hooks/useAuth.ts: Add token preservation check (lines 119-132)
- src/components/auth/ResetPasswordPage.tsx: Enhanced URL debugging

TESTING:
1. Request password reset
2. Click email link
3. Verify console shows: "Skipping normal auth init"
4. Verify password form appears without errors
5. Test password update succeeds
